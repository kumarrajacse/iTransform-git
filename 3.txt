1.As a result, they have provided you with the credentials for the service user and credentials to access their server. You have been asked to initialize a new Git repository in the /home/<user-name> directory called 'web-api'.

ans:-

mkdir web-api
cd web-api
git init -->to create repository


2.Once you have this new repository created, create a file called 'README.md' (be careful to mind the case of the file in order to follow your corporate standards for README files) that contains "Web-API v1" text. You will then need to add that file to the repository and commit the changes to the repository. Once you confirm that the default branch is up-to-date with no changes to commit, you may turn it back over to the team for use.

ans:-

touch README.md

echo "Web-API v1" > README.md

git status

git add README.md

git commit -m "addednewfile"

git status
