1.In your efforts to better support a development organization, you have begun experimenting with Git source control and its interactions with GitHub. In order to be able to provide secure access to any repositories that are in use, you will create a special SSH key (separate from any that may have been created for other local systems to authenticate through) to be able to make an exchange with GitHub, and identify a service account called 'cloud_user' with your own account.
You will need to use the OpenSSH Client's utilities to create this key. First, create a subdirectory in your account's home directory called 'githubkeys'. Using the appropriate tool, you will create a new key (the default encryption type and size will be acceptable according to your organization's security policy) in this new directory called 'github-service-key'. Once you have this key, find the public key file that matches then copy and paste that into the appropriate account profile information in GitHub. After giving the key a reference name, you should see it appear in the list of your authorized keys, that will confirm it is available for use when trying to securely connect to your account.

ans:-

open git bash/git

for secure access use 
command to get ssh key are-
ssh-keygen 
and gets .ssh directory
copy public to repository

use 
git clone git@github.com:GitPracticeRepo/MayPractice.git
